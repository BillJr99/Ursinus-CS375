  coursenum: CS375
  points: 10
  goals:
    - "To self-reflect upon your individual contributions to the group"
    - "To plan individual and group activities for the upcoming sprint"
    - "To ensure that work aligns with your Gantt chart and does not overlap the efforts of another."

      description: Self Reflection
      preemerging: The contributions, plans, or reflections are unclear or missing
      beginning: The self reflection indicates a summary of individual progress in the prior sprint that overlaps with the contributions of another.  The self reflection indicates a summary of individual activities for the upcoming sprint that overlaps with the contributions of another.  The reflection does not thoughtfully comment on technical challenges and areas of personal development.
      progressing: The self reflection indicates a summary of individual progress in the prior sprint that does not overlap with the contributions of another.  The self reflection indicates a summary of individual activities for the upcoming sprint that overlaps in minor ways with the contributions of another that can be resolved in a stand up meeting.  The reflection includes a thougtful discussion of technical challenges and areas for personal development. 
      proficient: The self reflection indicates a summary of individual progress in the prior sprint that does not overlap with the contributions of another.  The self reflection indicates a summary of individual activities for the upcoming sprint that does not overlap with the contributions of another.  The reflection includes a thougtful discussion of technical challenges and areas for personal development.

### What to Do

In the self-reflection, you are to periodically comment on these areas:

1. Your individual contributions during the prior sprint
2. Your planned individual contributions during the upcoming sprint
3. Any technical challenges that you face that are preventing you from achieving your planned contributions to the group
4. Any areas for personal and professional development that would better enable you to meet your planned contributions on-schedule
5. Was your group able to produce a prototype for this sprint, or to synthesize existing prototype(s) into a polished design?  If so, describe this here.
6. Provide a screenshot of your Kanban that reflects your Gantt chart tasks and the current state of those tasks.  If the Gantt chart does not already assign a point person to each task, indicate that on your reflection report here.

Your discussion of prior and planned individual contributions should align with the project plan and Gantt chart.  They should be generally on-schedule, or a group-led revision to the schedule should take place and be documented.  In addition, these contributions should not overlap with the claimed contributions of others.  In other words, you should comment on what, specifically, you accomplished during the past sprint (and what you plan to accomplish during the upcoming sprint).
