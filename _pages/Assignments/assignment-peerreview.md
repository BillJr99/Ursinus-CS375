### What to Do

Complete this review form for each of your peers, and one for yourself, and submit them together.  You should submit several copies of this form, one for each person.

Your grade for this assignment will be based in part upon the evaluation you received from your peers.  However, failing to submit this assignment in its entirety will result in a grade of 0 for this assignment, regardless of the peer feedback received for you.

#### Peer Review Survey

1. What is your name?
2. What is the name of the person you are evaluating?
3. On a scale of 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent), please evaluate the efficiency with which your partner completed assigned tasks
4. On a scale of 1 (very little) to 10 (very high), please evaluate the level of engagement of your partner throughout the entire semester.
5. If you were in a management position, would you hire your partner to work with you on a software project?
6. List three things your partner did well this year.
7. List three areas in which your partner could improve.
8. Suppose there were `n` people in your group, and you could give out a total of `100*(n-1)` points as a final grade.  How many points would this partner receive?  Note that the total number of points you give across all these forms should add up to `100*(n-1)`, so it is impossible to give everyone 100 points!  For example, a group of 4 could allocate scores to a sum total of 300 points.
