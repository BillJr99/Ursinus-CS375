The final step in your software project is documenting the work that you've done so that a) non-technical audiences can use your software, and b) technical users can deploy, maintain, and enhance your project.

You might consider writing the report in a way that would have benefitted you months ago when you first started the project, or in a way that would benefit you a year from now when you've forgotten all the details.  Screenshots and figures are essential here, as you are communicating your work to a broad audience.

### Code Coverage Report

In this report, include the results of your test plans: execute your unit tests, and indicate how many passed.  Also include the code coverage report.  Indicate the results of each user acceptance test that your stakeholders (or, if they are unavailable, your project group members) executed.

### Website

Include your report on the project website.
