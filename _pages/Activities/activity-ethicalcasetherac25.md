      questions:
        - "What was Malfunction 54?  What steps reproduced Malfunction 54?"
        - "What were some of the incremental steps taken by the FDA throughout the Therac-25 malfunctions?  Why were these actions incremental in nature, and why did/could the FDA not take stronger action?"
        - "What was an example of system analysists assigning improperly low risk probabilities to certain software failures?"
        - "What technological actions might have mitigated these failures?"
        - "What policy changes might have helped to raise these issues in a more timely manner?"
