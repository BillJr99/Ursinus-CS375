Submit your final presentation and codebase.  Each member of your group should have a speaking role in the presentation, which should last approximately 20 minutes (15 minutes speaking and demonstration, with 5 minutes of questions and answers).  You should rehearse your presentation as a group at least once before presenting!  Dress appropriately for the presentation, if you are able.

Your presentation should summarize your proposal, stakeholders, requirements, design, and test plan, and should also include a review of the codebase and a demo of the software.

### Website

Include your presentation and a link to your project github codebase on the project website.  Record a short demo of the major features of the software to a video, and upload the video to your website.  You can use Screencast-o-Matic ([https://screencast-o-matic.com/](https://screencast-o-matic.com/)) for this purpose, and can upload your work to youtube (or upload and link to the file on your webiste directly).
